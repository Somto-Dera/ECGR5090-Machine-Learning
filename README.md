# ECGR5105 - Machine-Learning

## Course Overview and Objectives:
Machine learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn and/or act
without being explicitly programmed. This course introduces machine learning principles and
provides foundations on a data-driven approach for machine intelligence and decision making.
The topics include variously supervised, unsupervised learning approaches (including deep
learning), optimization procedures, and statistical inference. During this course, The students will
digest and practice their knowledge and skills by class discussion, homework and exams, as well
as obtain in-depth experience with a particular topic through a final project.

## Course Topics:
1. Linear regression and logistic regression
2. Probabilistic classification (Na√Øve Bayes)
3. Support vector machine (SVM) and kernel approach
4. Sparse coding, sparse and collaborative representation
5. Deep learning
  - Feedforward neural networks
  - Convolutional neural networks
  - Recurrent neural networks
  - Good practice of deep neural networks implementation
6. Deep learning applications
  - low-level image processing
  - object detection
  - semantic segmentation
  - action recognition, etc.
8. Emerging topics in Machine Learning and Computer Vision (e.g., Generative Adversarial
Networks, DeepFake, Adversarial Robustness, Fairness, etc.)
